# ClimateCabinet

Climate Cabinet Group Project, 2021.


The main goal of the project is to test the working condition of the specimens at certain temperatures through a climate chamber and to facilitate the testing process. In this way it is determined at which temperatures the test specimens cannot function or at which temperatures they function most effectively.
